This Python program is a menu driven text processing tool. It lets the user enter a sentence and perform different operations on it, such as reversing the text, counting vowels, checking for palindromes, finding and replacing words, formatting in title case, splitting into words, counting word frequencies, and swapping letter cases. The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
